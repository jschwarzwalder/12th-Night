<p class="flow-text">Greetings Artisans of An Tir!</p>
<p class="flow-text">12th Night 2017 will host a Largess enhancing event popularly known as a Dirty Dozen Donation Derby!</p>
<p class="flow-text">This is an opportunity to show off any of your new or longtime favorite skills in a “theme and variations” demonstration. Making 12 of a same item or skill in various interpretations!</p>
<p class="flow-text">The “rules” for this derby are:</p>
<ol class="flow-text">
<li>Entrants must create twelve items, suitable for Largess, and that are based on a single theme.</li>
<li>Entries must have a common element/theme (toys, hats, needle books, time period), and be complete within the entry (games must each include all elements, socks are in sets of two!)</li>
<li>Within the common element, the variation is in the hands of the artisan!</li>
<li>Variations on the theme/element need not be documentable, this is not an A&S competition! However, identification of your thoughts in creating your set of 12 elements, may be of interest to the populace!</li>
<li>Entries must be tagged and ready for gifting when submitted to the competition.</li>
<li>Items should not include heraldry.</li>
<li>Judging will be by the Populace, voting by token at the display table (in the A&S space).</li>
<li>The WINNER (most tokens prior to the end of the Rapier tournament) will have the joy of selecting one of each of the entries as their own, with the other 11 elements of each entry handed over to Largess.</li>
<li>Entries will be displayed in the A&S area, and can be turned in on Friday, from 6:00 to 8:00, and Saturday from 9:00 til 11:00, at the display table in the A&S area. </li>
